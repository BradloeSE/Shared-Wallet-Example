# Shared-Wallet-Example
This is an example of a shared wallet I built while completing the Solidity Development Bootcamp.


Real World Use Cases:

💡 Allowance for Children per day/week/month to be able to spend a certain amount of funds.

💡 Employers give employees an allowance for their travel expenses.

💡 Businesses give contractors an allowance to spend a certain budget.


Summary of Functions:

👛 Provides an on-chain wallet smart contract.

💸 This wallet contract can store funds and let users withdraw again.

✌️ Can also give "allowance" to other, specific user-addresses.

🚫 Restricts the functions to specific user-roles (owner, user).

🔍 Re-Uses existing smart contracts (OpenZeppelin) which are already audited to the greatest extent.
